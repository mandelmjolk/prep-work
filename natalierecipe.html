	<body><h1>CHINESE EGG TARTS | YEAR OF THE MONKEY</h1>
	<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/18340521/DSC_0561.JPG">
		<p>It's my zodiac year, friends! This CNY, I decided to attempt a classic Hong Kong dessert that's perfect any time of day, including right after stuffing my face with dim sum. While pineapple buns are still my favourite childhood pastry, I do enjoy these creamy, silky tarts as well. Also, they are far easier to make at home.</p>
		<p>The key to every great tart is the crust. Although you'll find more traditional recipes go for lard, I use butter here because I prefer the flavour (and it was what I had on hand). Feel free to swap half the butter or lard to achieve a flakier pastry. </p>

	Notes: <p>
	These tarts are traditionally made in single aluminum tart shells (available at specialty stores) but I just used a standard muffin tin because they work just as well. Unbaked pie dough freezes really well, but I wouldn't keep the custard longer than a couple of days in the fridge.</p>

		<h2>CHINESE EGG TARTS</h2>
		<p><h3><strong>Crust</strong></h3></p>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 cups (200g) all purpose flour</li>
			<li>1/8 teaspoon salt</span></li>
			<li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
			<li>14 tbsp butter (200g), cubed</li>
			<li>2 tbsp cold water</li>
		</ul>
		<p></p>
		<h3><strong>Filling</strong></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>scant 1 cup hot water</li>
			<li>3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
			<li>1/2 cup evaporated milk, room temperature</li>
			<li>3/4 tsp pure vanilla extract
		</ul>

	<p>First, let's make the dough. In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt and sugar, until evenly distributed. Add the butter and break it up with your fingers until the butter is still visible throughout, in pea-sized chunks. Slowy drizzle the cold water into the flour mixture and knead until the dough just comes together. Form into a ball and wrap in plastic to refigerate for around 20 minutes.</p>
	<p>Once the dough has chilled, turn onto a lightly floured surface and press into a nice rectangle. Roll out the dough lengthwise, and then do a quarter turn, so the long side is facing you. Fold the dough from the top and then over itself from the bottom (like a letter). Repeat this rolling out and folding step two times (this creates pastry layers). Let chill in the fridge for another 20 minutes.</p>
	<p>To make the filling, dissolve the sugar into the hot water and let it cool slightly. Whip the eggs and evaporated milk, and then add the sugar water and vanilla extract. Keep beating until well combined and bubbles form. Then, using a fine mesh strainer, strain the liquid, removing as many of the bubbles as you can. This step is important to create a perfectly silky tart. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</p>
	<p>Roll out the chilled and rested dough into a circle about 1/4" thick. Cut the dough into rounds using a biscuit cutter (or jar rim) and place into a lightly greased shallow muffin tin. Reroll the scraps and repeat until all 12 tins are filled. Carefully pour the custard mixture into the shells (about 3/4 of the way full) and place into the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Afterwards, lower the heat to 350 degrees for another 10-12 minutes. Let cool for just a few mintues and then serve.</p>
